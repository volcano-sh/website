Volcano is system for running high performance workloads on
Kubernetes.  It provides a suite of mechanisms currently missing from
Kubernetes that are commonly required by many classes of high
performance workload including:

\-  Machine Learning/Deep Learning   
\-  Bioinformatics/Genomics    
\-  Other "big data" applications

These types of applications typically run on generalized domain
frameworks like Tensorflow, Spark, PyTorch, MPI, etc, which Volcano integrates with.

***

Volcano builds upon a decade and a half of experience running a wide
variety of high performance workloads at scale using several systems
and platforms, combined with best-of-breed ideas and practices from
the open source community.
