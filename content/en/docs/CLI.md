## Introduction
Volcano also provides commandline client to manage resources.
## Configuration

1. You can get commandline executable file **vcctl** from releases package **volcano-{version}-linux-gnu.tar.gz**. The 
file is under the path volcano-{version}-linux-gnu\bin\amd64 after unzipping the package. Of course, you can also make
your own executable file by cloning the code from github and execute the following command under the project root 
directory:
```
# make vcctl
``` 
2. Copy the executable file to $PATH so that you can use it anywhere.

## Commandline List

vcctl job list

```
# vcctl job list
