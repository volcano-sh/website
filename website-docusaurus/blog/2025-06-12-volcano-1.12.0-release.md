## Core Feature Details

### Network Topology-Aware Scheduling (Alpha Release)

Previously a preview feature in v1.11, Volcano's Network Topology-Aware Scheduling is now an Alpha release in v1.12. This feature is designed to optimize the deployment of AI tasks in large-scale training and inference scenarios (e.g., model-parallel training, leader-worker inference). By scheduling tasks within the same network topology performance domain, it reduces cross-switch communication, thereby significantly improving task efficiency. Volcano uses the HyperNode CRD to abstract and represent heterogeneous hardware network topologies and supports a hierarchical structure for easier management.

Version 1.12 integrates the following key features:

*   **HyperNode Auto-Discovery:** Volcano can now automatically discover the cluster's network topology. Users can configure the discovery type, and the system will automatically create and maintain hierarchical HyperNodes that reflect the cluster's actual network topology. It currently supports obtaining topology information from InfiniBand (IB) networks via the UFM (Unified Fabric Manager) interface to automatically update HyperNodes. Support for more network protocols like RoCE is planned for the future.
*   **Prioritized HyperNode Selection:** This version introduces a scoring strategy based on a combination of node-level and HyperNode-level scores to determine the final priority of a HyperNode.
    *   **Node-level:** It is recommended to configure the BinPack plugin to pack nodes within a HyperNode first, reducing resource fragmentation.
    *   **HyperNode-level:** Lower-level HyperNodes are prioritized for better performance, as they involve fewer cross-switch traversals. For HyperNodes at the same level, those containing more tasks receive a higher score to reduce HyperNode-level resource fragmentation.
*   **Node Matching with Label Selectors:** HyperNode leaf nodes are associated with physical nodes in the cluster and support the following three matching strategies:
    *   **Exact Match:** Directly matches node names.
    *   **Regex Match:** Matches node names using regular expressions.
    *   **Label Match:** Matches nodes using standard Label Selectors.

### Dynamic MIG Partitioning for GPU Virtualization

Volcano's GPU virtualization feature allows users to request partial GPU resources based on memory and compute power. It works with a Device Plugin to achieve hardware isolation and improve GPU utilization. While traditional GPU virtualization limits GPU usage by intercepting CUDA APIs, the MIG (Multi-Instance GPU) technology in the NVIDIA Ampere architecture allows a single physical GPU to be partitioned into multiple independent instances. However, typical MIG solutions often use pre-configured, fixed-size instances, which can lead to resource waste and inflexibility.

**Volcano v1.12 introduces dynamic MIG partitioning and scheduling capabilities.** It can select the appropriate MIG instance size in real-time based on the user's requested GPU amount and uses a Best-Fit algorithm to reduce resource waste. It also supports GPU scoring strategies like BinPack and Spread to minimize resource fragmentation and improve GPU utilization. Users can request resources using the unified APIs `volcano.sh/vgpu-number`, `volcano.sh/vgpu-cores`, and `volcano.sh/vgpu-memory`, without needing to be aware of the underlying implementation details.

Thanks to the following community developers for their contributions to this feature: **@sailorvii, @archlitchi**.

### Support for Dynamic Resource Allocation (DRA)

Kubernetes DRA (Dynamic Resource Allocation) is a native feature that provides a more flexible and powerful way to manage heterogeneous hardware resources in a cluster, such as GPUs, FPGAs, and high-performance network cards. It addresses the limitations of the traditional Device Plugin model in some advanced scenarios. Volcano v1.12 adds support for DRA, allowing the cluster to dynamically allocate and manage external resources, which enhances Volcano's integration with the Kubernetes ecosystem and improves the flexibility of resource management.

Thanks to community developer **@JesseStutler** for their contribution to this feature.

### Queue Capacity Management in Volcano Global

Queues are a core concept in Volcano. To support quota management in multi-cluster and multi-tenant environments, Volcano v1.12 extends its global queue capacity management capabilities. Users can now uniformly limit tenant resource usage in a multi-cluster environment. The configuration is consistent with the single-cluster scenario: the `capability` field in the queue configuration is used to limit tenant quotas.

Thanks to community developer **@tanberBro** for their contribution to this feature.

### Security Enhancements

The Volcano community is committed to security. In v1.12, in addition to fine-grained control over sensitive permissions like ClusterRoles, the following security risks have been addressed and hardened:

*   **Set Timeouts for HTTP Servers:** The Metric and Healthz endpoints of all Volcano components now have server-side `ReadHeader`, `Read`, and `Write` timeouts to prevent prolonged resource occupation. (PR: [https://github.com/volcano-sh/volcano/pull/4208](https://github.com/volcano-sh/volcano/pull/4208))
*   **Add Warning for Skipping SSL Certificate Verification:** When a client request sets `insecureSkipVerify` to `true`, a warning is logged to recommend enabling SSL certificate verification in production environments. (PR: [https://github.com/volcano-sh/volcano/pull/4211](https://github.com/volcano-sh/volcano/pull/4211))
*   **Disable Volcano Scheduler's pprof Endpoint by Default:** To prevent the leakage of sensitive program information, the profiling data port used for troubleshooting is now disabled by default. (PR: [https://github.com/volcano-sh/volcano/pull/4173](https://github.com/volcano-sh/volcano/pull/4173))
*   **Remove Unnecessary File Permissions:** Unnecessary execute permissions have been removed from Go source files to follow the principle of least privilege. (PR: [https://github.com/volcano-sh/volcano/pull/4171](https://github.com/volcano-sh/volcano/pull/4171))
*   **Set Security Context for Containers and Run as Non-Root:** All Volcano components now run with non-root privileges. Security contexts have been added with `seccompProfile` and `SELinuxOptions`, and `allowPrivilegeEscalation` is set to `false` to prevent container privilege escalation. Only necessary Linux capabilities are retained, comprehensively restricting container permissions. (PR: [https://github.com/volcano-sh/volcano/pull/4207](https://github.com/volcano-sh/volcano/pull/4207))
*   **Limit HTTP Response Body Size:** For HTTP requests sent by the Extender Plugin and ElasticSearch Service, the response body size is limited to prevent issues like OOM caused by excessive resource consumption. (Advisory: [https://github.com/volcano-sh/volcano/security/advisories/GHSA-hg79-fw4p-25p8](https://github.com/volcano-sh/volcano/security/advisories/GHSA-hg79-fw4p-25p8))

### Performance Improvements for Large-Scale Scenarios

Volcano's performance is continuously being optimized. The new version removes and disables some non-essential webhooks by default without affecting functionality, improving performance in large-scale batch creation scenarios:

*   **PodGroup Mutating Webhook Disabled by Default:** Previously, when a PodGroup was created without a specified queue, the queue could be populated from the Namespace. Since this scenario is uncommon, this webhook is now disabled by default. Users can enable it if needed.
*   **Queue Status Check Moved from Pod to PodGroup:** Task submission is not allowed when a queue is in a closed state. The original validation logic was performed at the Pod creation stage. Since Volcano's basic scheduling unit is the PodGroup, moving the validation to the PodGroup creation stage is more efficient. As the number of PodGroups is less than the number of Pods, this change reduces webhook calls and improves performance.

Thanks to community developer **@Monokaix** for their contribution to this feature.

### Gang Scheduling for Various Workload Types

Gang scheduling is a core capability of Volcano. For Volcano Job and PodGroup objects, users can directly set `minMember` to define the required minimum number of replicas. In the new version, users can specify this minimum by setting the annotation `scheduling.volcano.sh/group-min-member` on other types of workloads such as Deployments, StatefulSets, and Jobs. This means that when using Volcano for scheduling, either the specified number of replicas are all scheduled successfully, or none are scheduled at all, enabling Gang scheduling for a wider variety of workload types.

For example, to set `minMember=10` for a Deployment:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: volcano-group-deployment
  annotations:
    # Set min member=10
    scheduling.volcano.sh/group-min-member: "10"
```

### Job Flow Enhancements

Job Flow is a lightweight workflow orchestration framework for Volcano Jobs. In v1.12, Job Flow has been enhanced with the following improvements:

*   New Monitoring Metrics: Added metrics for the number of successful and failed Job Flows.
*   DAG Validity Check: Introduced a function to validate the structure of a Job Flow's Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).
*   State Synchronization Fix: Resolved an issue that caused inaccurate Job Flow state synchronization.

#### Pre-Upgrade Notes

Before upgrading to Volcano v1.12, please note the following changes:

*   **PodGroup Mutating Webhook Disabled by Default:** In v1.12, the PodGroup's Mutating Webhook is disabled by default. If you have workflows that rely on the webhook to automatically populate a PodGroup's queue from its Namespace, you must manually enable this webhook after upgrading.
*   **Queue Status Check Migration and Behavioral Change:** The queue status validation logic for task submission has been moved from the Pod creation stage to the PodGroup creation stage. Now, when a queue is closed, the system will prevent task submission at the PodGroup creation time. However, individual Pods (not submitted via a PodGroup) can still be submitted to a closed queue, but they will not be scheduled by the Volcano Scheduler.
*   **Volcano Scheduler pprof Endpoint Disabled by Default:** For security reasons, the Volcano Scheduler's pprof endpoint is disabled by default in this version. If needed, it can be explicitly enabled via the Helm parameter `custom.scheduler_pprof_enable=true` or the command-line argument `--enable-pprof=true`.
